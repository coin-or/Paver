Requirements:
  Python 3.x (http://www.python.org/)
  Python NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/)
  Python matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/)
  Python Pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/)

The following versions seem to work:
  Python 3.6.6, Numpy 1.14.5, matplotlib 2.2.2, Pandas 0.23.1

ATTENTION: Pandas >= 0.25 does not work.
(Paver uses Pandas' Panel, which was removed with Pandas 0.25.)

For help on usage, execute:
  python ./src/paver/paver.py -h

For examples, see do*.sh scripts in examples subdirectory.
